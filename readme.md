# Freemarker Templates for use with Android Studio

> Android Studio provides code templates that follow the Android design and development best practices to get you on the right track to creating beautiful, functional apps

Thus sayeth the [Android Studio documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/templates.html).

You can also create your own templates to be included in this menu.  I used [this tutorial](https://riggaroo.co.za/custom-file-template-group-android-studiointellij/) to learn how it worked.

This repository hosts the templates I use.
